        <br><h2>What can you do?</h2>
            <p><strong>Attract birds to the garden</strong></p>
                <p>Did you know that birds can increase your property value, reduce stress, and contribute to pest control?  Luckily, it's very easy to start bringing more birds to your back garden.</p>
                <ul><strong>Set up bird feeders.</strong>  Fill them with tasty treats such as sunflower seeds, suet balls, and peanuts.  Different treats will attract different types of birds, so it's worth doing your research if you want to attract a specific type of bird.</ul>
                <ul><strong>Plant bird-friendly flowers.</strong>  This is a win-win; birds are attracted to natural plants, which require less water and are less likely to spread diseases in your garden!  Try planting some trees and shrubs which provide shelter for birds, or wildflowers to attract insects for the birds to feed on.</ul>
                <ul><strong>Provide fresh water.</strong>  You could set out a bird bath, but even a simple bowl of water will do.  Whatever you use, make sure it's placed in the shade and somewhere birds can watch out for predators.</ul>
            <p><strong>Make your garden hedgehog-friendly</strong></p>
            <p>If you're a gardener, you'll love having hedgehogs in your garden.  These adorable animals act as a natural pest-control, eating slugs, snails, and insects that would otherwise munch on your plants.  Here's how you can make your garden irresistable for a hedgehog:</p>
                <ul><strong>Grow a hedge.</strong>  As their name suggests, hedgehogs build their nests in hedges, bushes, and shrubs.  Make sure to leave a gap so they can get in and out; alternatively, if you can't grow a hedge, make a gap in your fence so they can easily get into your garden.</ul>
                <ul><strong>Leave some food and water.</strong>  Hedgehogs are unlikely to come back if they aren't finding enough to eat, so to make sure they return, consider leaving them a little extra something for encouragement.  If you have a cat or a dog, you can leave some of their food out, making sure it's accessible for hedgehogs but not where other animals can easily steal it.</ul>
                <ul><strong>Make a hedgehog house.</strong> These can be assembled by hand or built ready-made, and are a great place to leave food for the hedgehogs if that's something you want to do.  Hedgehogs are solitary creatures, so if you have a few visiting the garden regularly, make sure they each have a shelter of their own.</ul>
            <p><strong>Switch out your lawn for a meadow</strong></p>
                <p>Growing a meadow is a great way to attract bees and other insects to your garden!  Plus, you only need to maintain it a few times a year rather than constantly mowing, and you can grow a variety of different plants and wildflowers.  Interested?  Here's how:</p>
                <ul>Keep mowing weekly for the first year to weaken the grass, but don't use weed-killer or anything to feed the turf.</ul>
                <ul>Raise some plants in pots and introduce them to the garden after a year or two - plant them in small groups of the same plant for a more natural look.</ul>
                <ul>Look for "plug plants" from wildflower suppliers that can be transferred to your garden.</ul>
